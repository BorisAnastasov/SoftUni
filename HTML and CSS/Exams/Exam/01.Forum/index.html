        <p>Stay away from those people who try to disparage your ambitions. Small minds will always do that, but great
          minds will give you a feeling that you can become great too.

        <p>Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The ability to direct individual
          accomplishments toward organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows common people to attain uncommon
          results. Individual commitment to a group effortâ€”that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society
          work,
          a civilisation work.

        <p>Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to
          become the best of which you are capable.
